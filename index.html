                <p1>The Treaty of Waitangi, signed on February 6, 1840, is a pivotal document in New Zealand's history. It represents an agreement between the indigenous M훮ori chiefs (represented by over 500 signatories) and the British Crown, establishing the foundation for the relationship between the two parties and laying down principles of governance, land ownership, and rights.</p1>

                <img id='image2' class="class1" src='Images/image2.jpg' alt="image2" width=300px;>
                 <p1>The Treaty of Waitangi involves two primary parties: the M훮ori, the indigenous Polynesian people of New Zealand, and the British Crown, representing the colonial government of the United Kingdom. The M훮ori chiefs and representatives from various iwi (tribes) across New Zealand participated in the negotiations and signing of the treaty, alongside representatives of the British government.</p1>

                <img id='image3' class="class1" src='Images/image3.jpg' alt="image3" width=300px;>
                 <p1>The history surrounding the Treaty of Waitangi is complex and multifaceted. It originates from the British Crown's desire to establish sovereignty over New Zealand while recognizing M훮ori ownership and rights to their lands. However, interpretations and implementations of the treaty's articles have led to significant disputes, conflicts, and debates over its true meaning and implications, shaping the socio-political landscape of New Zealand for generations to come. Understanding its historical context is crucial for comprehending its ongoing significance and the challenges faced in its application.</p1>
